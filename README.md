# Ab Initio X-ray Diffraction [1]
---

### Usage


Main code: AIXRD2016.m


Modify setup2.txt, which contains 5 columns, title, Nq, wl, dim, method.

title: results/'output'.mat will be created with 'output' based on 'title'.

Nq: Number of points in momentum transfer vector (q, inverse bohr).

wl: X-ray wavelength in atomic units (Bohr)

dim: Dimension. Can either be x, y, or z which gives 1D slices through q of size (Nq,1);

detx, dety, detz, which give 2D detector images (functions of scattering angles theta, phi)
 
of size (Nq,Nq) for incoming x-rays from the x, y, and z direction respectively; 

xyz, which gives a 3D grid in q of size (Nq,Nq,Nq); 

finally sph, which gives a 3D grid in q in spherical coordinates of size (Nq,Nq,Nq), 

and by default gives rotationally-averaged curve and Debye approximation (for comparison).

method: Either iam or ai. That is, independent atom model (IAM, v. fast), 

or ab initio x-ray diffraction (AIXRD, slow) from [1]. 


setup2.txt must be:
% beginning of file

title  Nq  wl  dim  method


title1 Nq1 wl1 dim1 method1

title2 Nq2 wl2 dim2 method2

% end of file 


Run AIXRD2016.m to iterate over setup2.txt.

Results get saved to results/ folder in .mat format.

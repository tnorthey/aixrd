How to run AIXRD
T. Northey 2015
Main code: AIXRD_v3_stable.m

Usage:
Modify setup2.txt, containing 5 columns, title, Nq, wl, dim, method.
title: Arbitrary title, output .mat file will contain this title
Nq: Number of points in q-vector 
wl: x-ray wavelength in atomic units (Bohr)
dim: dimension, can be x,y,z which gives 1D slices through q of size (Nq,1);
detx, dety, detz, which give 2D detector images (functions of scattering 
angles theta, phi) of size (Nq,Nq) for incoming x-rays from the x, y, and z 
direction respectively; xyz, which gives a 3D grid in q of size (Nq,Nq,Nq); 
finally sph, which gives a 3D grid in q in spherical coordinates of size 
(Nq,Nq,Nq), and by default gives rotational-average and Debye approximation.
method: Either iam or ai, which means independent atom model (IAM, v. fast) 
approximation, or ab initio x-ray diffraction (AIXRD, slow) from [1]. 

setup2.txt looks like:
%-------------------------------%
title  Nq  wl  dim  method

hehe 49 3 detz ai
%-------------------------------%

In this case, running AIXRD_v3_stable.m will use data from the file 
input/hehe.mld (dihelium molden file from molpro).
Appropriate results get saved to results/ folder in .mat format.

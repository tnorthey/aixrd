This Matlab code analytically calculates the x-ray form-factor, f(q), from an ab initio calculation.
Theory is shown in Northey, Zotev, Kirrander, "Ab Initio Molecular Diffraction", JCTC 2014.

The example output file given is from a H2 Hartree-Fock calculation with minimal basis set.
The intensity |f(q)|^2 is plotted as a function of theta and phi using the function polarplot3d.

To use code type e.g.,

aixrd_Jul7('h2.mld',30,0);
